# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, MongoDB, Node.js and Express.js

This project revolves around a "fuzzy" search algorithm, where the users search will autocomplete to movie names that include the substring they've typed, or are relevant to a movies title, as long as they have 3 or more characters typed in the search input.

# Optimizations:
Things I want to continue adding include more CRUD operations for more interactivity, such as favorites, already seen, no interest in watching, watchlist, etc.

Also, it would be convenient for users if there were links or logos to where you can watch each movie.


# Lessons Learned:

I learned that there are an overwhelming amount of movies available to watch. In addition, the importance of environment variables to secure a database connection is absolutely vital.
